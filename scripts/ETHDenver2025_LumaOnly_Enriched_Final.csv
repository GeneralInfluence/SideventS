Mount Elbert Climb,,,,,https://lu.ma/f2objzva,,,,,,,"Finishing ethDenver strong, we will be climbing the tallest peach in the rocky mountains : Mount. Elbert.

​

​14,433 feet Peak elevation.
5,000 feet elevation gain
8.5hours up and down
12.3 Miles RT trail length
2.2hours drive from Denver

We'll take the traditional winter route on the East Ridge of Colorado's highest peak. The road to the 2WD South Elbert Trailhead and parking area is paved and kept clear. There are no bathrooms at this trailhead. The first couple of miles of this route involve walking up the 4WD road to reach the summer, 4WD trailhead.

​Nearly 15 miles roundtrip for the day. While this route is a fairly gradual and gentle slope, don't under estimate the effort. We are still looking at nearly 5,000 vertical feet in elevation gain.

Depending on snowpack snowshoes may be advisable for less Post-Holing. Of coarse it is winter and Colorado is windy so make sure to be extra warm, windproof, snow proof. Last snow report was 29inches deep.

For anyone that does not have mountaineering experience we'll ask you to buddy up with someone that does. Never any shame in turning back we are here for the nature.

We will do one climb right before ethDenver right after.
